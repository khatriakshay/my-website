        <p>This is Akshay Mair
          Van life for me is a mixture of three things nature, self and adventure. Always had a dream to travel this beautiful country and listen to people's life story as everyone is a story itself.
          There are deep connections that bounds us together and i wanna live the why's to realise journey; as to why i am curious or uncertain and to realise i am enlightened. I have a blue bird in me who is guide for me, that never want to walk the
          path millions have walked who strive to work for a meaning.</p>
